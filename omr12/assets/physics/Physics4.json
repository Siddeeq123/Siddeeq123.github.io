        "0": "Answer : \n\nPositive\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nIf a force acting on a body has a component in the direction of displacement, then the work done by the force is positive. Hence when a body falls freely under the influence of gravity the work done by the gravity is positive.",
        "1": "Answer : \n\nYes\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nWhen a gas filled win a cylinder fitted with a movable piston is allowed to expand, the work done by the gas is positive, because of the force due to gas pressure and displacement act in the same direction.",
        "2": "Answer : \n\nNegative\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nIf a force acting on a body has a component in the opposite direction of displacement, the work done is negative, when a body slides against a rough horizontal surface, its displacement is opposite to that of the force of friction. He works done by the friction is negative.",
        "3": "Answer : \n\nNo\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nWhen a body is lifted, the work done by the gravitational force is negative. This is because the gravitational force acts vertically downwards while the displacement is in vertically upward direction.",
        "4": "Answer : \n\nZero\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nFor a body moving in a circular path, the centripetal force and the displacement are perpendicular to each other. So the work done by the centripetal force is zero.",
        "5": "Answer : \n\nYes\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nWhen a coolie walks on a horizontal platform with load on his head, he applies force in the upward direction equal to its weight. The displacement of the load is along the horizontal direction. Thus the work done by the coolie on the load is zero.",
        "6": "Answer : \n\n1960J\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nF = 20kg wt = 20×9.8N\ns = 20m\nθ = 60°\nW = Fscosθ = 20×9.8×20×cos\u206160°\nW = 1960J.",
        "7": "Answer : \n\n100J\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nF = 10N, s = 5m, θ = 90°\nWork done, W1=Fscosθ = 10×5×cos90° = 0\nFor vertical motion, the angle between force and displacement is 0°.\nHere, F = 10N, s = 10m, θ=0°\nWork done, W2=10×10×cos0 = 100J\nTotal work done = W1+W2 = 100J.",
        "8": "Answer : \n\nYes\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nA moving hammer possesses kinetic energy as it is in virtue of motion. A moving object can do work. Therefore a moving hammer drives a nail into the wood.",
        "9": "Answer : \n\nKinetic energy\n\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe kinetic energy of a body by virtue of its motion is called kinetic energy. A moving object can do work. Therefore a bullet fired from a gun can pierce a target due to its kinetic energy."
